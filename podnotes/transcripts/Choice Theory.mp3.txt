Hi Seth, my name is Dave. I'm a composer and a teacher. My question has to do with shiny objects. I have a lot of ideas all of the time. Some of these ideas are creative. Others are more entrepreneurial. But how do I know when I'm on to a good idea? How do I know when I'm attracted to the object and not just attracted to the shiny? I think of the shiny as the end to be gained, the success, the riches that await, if you will, when really most of the time that's just scarcity.

So how do I know when I find a good idea that's not driven by scarcity. That's not driven by the end result. Thanks very much for everything that you do. Much appreciated.

Yeah, I hear you. This is a common problem. People with ideas tend to have ideas. There are a few people who have just one idea, but that's pretty rare. If you get in the habit of exploring the fringes, you will find ideas. And then the question comes up, what are they for? Is it like humming a song every day just to entertain yourself? If that's the case, hum away. Inventing ideas that you never ship is a fine pastime.

But for many people, the purpose of an idea is to make a change happen. We do not make a change happen with an idea. The idea itself accomplishes very little. We make a change happen by implementing the idea, by shipping the idea, by refining it, by evolving it, by bringing it to the right people, by exploiting the opportunity, by expending emotional labour, by experiencing failure, learning and doing it again. And all of that can be exhausting and enervating.

And much of it doesn't work. And it all takes time away from that thing we said we like doing, which is coming up with the ideas in the first place. So how to dig ourselves out of this paradox? Well, I have a very practical suggestion for you. And I've tried this with people who say they have too many ideas and it tends to focus the mind. Today is Wednesday. Go ahead and give yourself five days.

And five days from now you need to have five ideas, five of the ideas you've been carrying around, protecting, nurturing, five ideas, one page per idea.

That one page needs to explain: What's the idea? Who's it for? What's it for? What's the change you seek to make? How are you going to bring it to market? Where is the leverage? A little bit of a roadmap about how to get from here to there.

Write 'em all up, five of them, and then sit with a few trusted friends and say, here are the five. And force them to pick one. Have a vote and whichever one they pick you have to do. You have to. You have given agency to them, you must follow through, you set it up, they pick it.

The reason this works is because you will approach that meeting five days from now differently, knowing that the only ideas you can bring to that meeting are ideas you're actually prepared to commit to, to do something about. You don't have to have the meeting in five days. You can just act like it. And then when you realise you're not ready, you can cycle one or two more times. But then you gotta have the meeting. Because the thing is, ideas in private are safe. Ideas in private are fun because we don't have to expose ourselves to the market. But if we're here to make a change happen, we have to commit. We have to pick an idea. We have to be able to say here I made this.

Thank you for caring about the work. Thank you for shipping the work. We'll see you next time.
